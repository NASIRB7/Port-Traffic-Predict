# Port Traffic Prediction

## Introduction

This Python script employs linear regression to predict the hour of port traffic based on historical data. The dataset, sourced from 'Port traffic Q3 2023.CSV', is preprocessed to extract relevant features. The model is trained using scikit-learn, allowing users to input new data for predicting the hour of port traffic.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn

## File Structure
- port_traffic_prediction.py: The main Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
- Port traffic Q3 2023.CSV: CSV file containing historical port traffic data.


## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasser77/port-traffic-q3-2023
